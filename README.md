### Automatically Download Open Course Video from NetEase http://open.163.com ###

All the download links are supported by offical website. What the app does is to download multifiles concurrently and rename the files in organized way. You just need to input URL you want to download or use automatically generated URL lists. Modify the input whatever you want and at least make it List of URLs, as ["URL1", "URL2", ... ].

Multi-process download is supported and 5-10 tasks at the same time is suggested as not to push too much pressure on the server side. Hence the download order is not based on the order of lessons (prevention from congestion).

Enjoy!
